The scope of this project is to demonstrate an end-to-end solution for leveraging LLMs, in a way that mitigates the privacy and cost concerns. We will utilise LLMWare, an open-source framework for industrial-grade enterprise LLM apps development, the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) method [1], and the BLING - a newly introduced collection of open-source small models, solely run on CPU.
