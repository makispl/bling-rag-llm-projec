## Introduction
It's been no more than a year now, where GPT stardust ‚ú® covered almost any sector globally. More and more experts, from any field, crave to utilise Large Language Models (LLM) in order to optimise their workflow. Evidently, the corporate world could not be absent from this new trend's safari. The future promises unprecedented possibilities, yet wrapped in the suited‚Ä¶ cost.

## Scope
This project aims to demonstrate  an end-to-end solution for leveraging LLMs, in a way that mitigates the privacy and cost concerns. We will utilise LLMWare, an open-source framework for industrial-grade enterprise LLM apps development, the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) method, and the BLING‚Ää-‚Ääa newly introduced collection of open-source small models, solely run on CPU.
